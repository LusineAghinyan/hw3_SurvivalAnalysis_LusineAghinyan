Customer Lifetime Value and Survival Analysis

Project Overview
This project focuses on applying survival analysis to a telecommunications dataset to estimate the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and
assess factors influencing customer churn. Utilizing parametric Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) models, the analysis aims to uncover valuable
insights into customer retention and inform strategic decision-making.


Homework Context
- Objective: To build, compare, and visualize survival models using the dataset provided, identify significant predictors of churn, and calculate the CLV of customers.
- Goals:
  - Build AFT models with available distributions.
  - Compare the models and visualize survival curves.
  - Interpret model coefficients to understand churn factors.
  - Calculate CLV and explore its variation across different customer segments.
  - Write a report summarizing the findings, particularly focusing on customer segments that are valuable and at risk.
 
Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following fields:
- ID: Unique subscriber identifier
- Region: Subscriber's regional code
- Tenure: Duration (in months) the subscriber has been with the company
- Age: Subscriber's age
- Marital Status: Whether the subscriber is married
- Address: Number of years the subscriber has lived at the current address
- Income: Annual income of the subscriber in thousand units
- Education: Education level of the subscriber
- Retirement Status: Whether the subscriber is retired
- Gender: Gender of the subscriber
- Service Usage: Subscription details for voice, internet, and call forwarding services
- Customer Category: Category of the customer based on service type
- Churn: Whether the subscriber has churned or not

Results
The analysis provides:
- Model comparison results and visualizations of survival curves.
- CLV calculations across various segments.
- Strategic insights into which customer segments are more likely to churn.
